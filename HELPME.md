# Read this if you dont know what to do

* Step one, setup a visual studios project.

    -If you dont already know how to do this then I suggest you just stop, go read up on visual studios and get comfortable using it.

* Step two, finding a RPM/WPM method.
    -This project is only the external part of the cheat. The offsets for the cheats are outdated, meaning that you cannot just ctrl+c and ctrl+v and expect it to work. At the very least you are going to need a way to RPM (read process memory) and WPM (write process memory). If you dont know what that means I suggest you read about it [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/memoryapi/nf-memoryapi-readprocessmemory), [here](https://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/c-and-c-/223957-read-memory-write-memory.html) or [here](https://www.mpgh.net/forum/showthread.php?t=261563).

* Step three, finishing the functions in MemoryFunctons.h

    -Complete the function body for all of the functions inside of MemoryFunction.h

* Step four, find offsets.

    *1.)

    -Download hamachi or any other P2P vpn software. Download [here](https://vpn.net), setup an account/network, have a friend connect.

* 2.) 

    -Open the game. Create a local match, and have your freind connect (make sure hes on your hamachi network). I suggest you edit the rounds to be as long as possible and the drone faze the fastest (save you some time)

* 3.) 

    -Disable battleye (open task manager -> find battleye services -> disable)

* 4.)

    -Start cheat engine and start finding your offsets! (I'm not going to go into detail about finding specific offsets becuase that is a little out of the scope of this readme).
